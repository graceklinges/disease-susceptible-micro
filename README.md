Abstract: Nutrient pollution is linked to coral disease susceptibility and severity, but the mechanism behind this effect remains underexplored. Exposure to inorganic nutrients can cause significant shifts in the coral microbiome towards a dysbiotic state and increase the expression of genes involved in coral innate immunity as well as of virulence-related genes in coral-associated microbes. A recently identified bacterial parasite of Caribbean Acropora, "Ca. Aquarickettsia rohweri" (Aquarickettsia) is strongly nutrient-responsive and high abundance of this bacterium is associated with reduced host growth and increased susceptibility to disease. Aquarickettsia lacks most genes involved in amino acid production and is hypothesized to assimilate host metabolites and to scavenge host ATP. As nutrient enrichment is a pervasive issue in the Caribbean, this study examined the influence of individual nutrient constituents (nitrate, ammonium, and phosphate) as well as combined nutrients on coral microbiome structure and Aquarickettsia abundance as well as on coral growth rates. Microbial diversity was found to decline over the course of the experiment in phosphate-, nitrate-, and combined-treated samples, corresponding with an increase in Aquarickettsia abundance. Quantitative PCR confirmed that Aquarickettsia abundance increased significantly across all corals, including those that did not receive additional nutrient enrichment outside that associated with onsite nearshore water conditions. While all conditions led to increased Aquarickettsia total abundances, only treatments amended with phosphate exhibited a significant shift in Aquarickettsia abundance relative to other taxa. Furthermore, corals exposed to phosphate treatments or a combination of phosphate and other nutrient constituents had significantly lower linear extension than untreated or nitrate-treated corals after 3 weeks of nutrient exposure. Together these data suggest that while experimental tank conditions, with an elevated nutrient regime associated with the nearshore water source, induced increases in total bacterial abundance over the course of experimentation, only the addition of phosphate significantly altered the dominance of Aquarickettsia over other members of the microbiome.
